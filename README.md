# Personal-Website
This is a Personal Website I made to showcase my skills and my portfolio.
I created this website by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2 of the portfolio pages -- "Portfolio 02" and "Portfolio 03" are incomplete and will be revisited later.

Tjis was my first solo project in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I learned a lot about design and about overcoming
the programming issues that came up with design changes.
